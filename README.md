The React frontend to the Homebrew App Store. This is a rough equivalent to the console's [hb-appstore](https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore), but on the web.

It can be viewed online at [apps.fortheusers.org](https://hb-app.store)

## Localization
We are in the process of adding translations for the website. If you are able to help, we would greatly appreciate a [PR](https://github.com/fortheusers/hbas-frontend/pulls) for other languages!

Localization files go in `src/locales`, and see the [en.json](https://github.com/fortheusers/hbas-frontend/blob/main/src/locales/en.json) for the format and a list of keys. Thank you!
